WHAT IS THIS?
This is my README, a document intended to help introduce you to myself, my working style, philosophy and expectations.
The intended audience is primarily anyone who is directly involved in working with me, though anyone is free to read it as well as provide feedback on it.

Please hold me accountable to my promises and call out anything that might be missing from this document.

This document was inspired by several others found online, few parts of it have been reported when particularly resonating with the concepts I wanted to express.

MY PRINCIPLES

Availability.
I like being helpful quickly. In case I'm traveling you will be notified in advance.
Sometimes I work on weekends but I do not expect you to do the same.

Humans come first.
I am a strong advocate of a transparent culture and free flow of information. Happy humans buld awesome products and that's why I try hard to optimize for humans first.

Diversity.
All different perspectives and differences in ideologies are relevant and key to and effective team.

System Vision.
I like to reduce complex things into systems to quickly find out issues. When I see inefficiencies in systems, I'll be looking for your help to fix them.

PERSONAL

I am a wide variety of interests making me a kind of jack-of-all-trades and master-of-none. Above everything I love the outdoors, hiking and camping with my Italian-Canadian wife. I can eat (almost) all the time. I love dogs and I might be getting one soon (yes you'll be able to pet it).

FEEDBACK

I'm going to try hard and always ask for feedback. All-the-time-feedback is my goal. I might sound persistent but when trying to build and advanced yet acceptable product I believe honest feedback is the greatest foundation. Don't get me wrong, I have opinions (sometimes strong ones) but the less bias is created, the less entropy is generated, the more transparent and free-flowing our work can be.

COMMUNICATION
I always prefer to talk face to face whenever possible. All other means of communication work just fine with me, forgive me in advance for being slow with emails on a Monday after a long weekend.
